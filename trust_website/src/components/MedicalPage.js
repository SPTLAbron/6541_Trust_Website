            Mrs. Lakshmi Srinivasan was a graceful who exuded warmth with her
            charming smile. With minimal formal education, she self-taught
            herself and was fluent in 6 languages. She showed exemplary kindness
            to all humans irrespective of their social status and religious
            affiliations. As a recognition of Mrs. Srinivasan unflinching
            kindness particularly towards those who suffered chronic and life-
            threating illnesses, this fundâ€™s aim is to help people with acute
            life- threatening health issues.
