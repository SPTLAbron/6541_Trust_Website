          This trust was established to commemorate and celebrate the story of 5
          Indian boys who lived in abject poverty but through sheer perseverance
          of a gutsy single mother, grew up to become very successful in their
          own lives. Some of these boys have gone onto become captains of their
          chosen fields. This success would not have been possible without the
          help of a few remarkable individuals who guided the boys through
          thoughtful counseling and setting up a value system that has stood the
          test of time. The boys and their mother grew up at 6541 Kumarguda, a
          single room partitioned into multiple rooms by cardboard structures.
          In the collective minds of the boys, 6541 Trust represents what can be
          accomplished with perseverance, hard work and most importantly, help
          and mentorship from generous individuals.
