      Mrs. Pankajam is an amazing and resilient woman.
Forced to quit school and get married at the age of 13, and becoming a mother of 6
boys by age 27, she struggled to support her family survive as a single mother. So,
rather than give up, she went back and finished high school, got a job as an
accountant and continued her education and got a college degree. Looking back, this
required a lot of guts and resolution to succeed in a male-dominated society. Her
hard work and single-mindedness to set a goal and methodically, achieve it rubbed
off on her 6 children who got inspiration from her. Because of her own personal
experience Mrs. Pankajam has always had a desire to help single mothers who are
striving to help their children succeed in life. So, this fund is set up in honor of Mrs.
Pankajam to seek out and empower women particularly, single mothers struggling to
bring up children and poor children welfare including education.
